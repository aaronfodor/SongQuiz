FEW WORDS FROM THE DEVELOPER

I always loved music trivia games, but I never found one which would have contained enough songs to be challenging in the long run.

Song Quiz makes it possible to play on billions of playlists, solving this issue entirely for free. It can be played with any Spotify playlist - with roughly 4 billion out there, the selection is wide. You can also add your own Spotify playlists. This application has a speech-oriented user interface that makes it easy to use. For example, you can play while traveling, taking a shower, and so on.

The business model is pretty much that anyone who loves music can indulge his/her passion.

I hope you enjoy it and have as much fun with it as much as I did making it.

-Aaron
