## Few words from the developer

I always loved music trivia games, but I never found one which would have contained enough songs to be challenging in the long run.

Song Quiz makes it possible to play on billions of playlists, providing an alternative entirely for free. It can be played with any Spotify playlist - with roughly 4 billion out there. You can also add your own Spotify playlists. This application has a speech-oriented user interface, but typing is also possible. It is easy to use - you can play while traveling, take a shower, etc.

The business model is pretty much that anyone who loves music can indulge their passion.

I hope you enjoy it and have as much fun with it as I did making it.
